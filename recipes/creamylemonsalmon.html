        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh salmon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>flour for dredging</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>fresh parsley, chopped, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your salmon into 4 pieces. Sprinkle with 
                garlic powder and season with salt and pepper. 
                Dredge each piece in flour on all sides.
            </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and butter to skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Add fish when hot. Cook 
                for 3-4 minutes per side or until nicely browned.
                 Be careful not to overcook - the salmon shouldn't 
                 be fully cooked yet. Remove from pan and set 
                 aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, Italian 
                seasoning, and Dijon mustard to the pan. Stir 
                until mustard has dissolved, and let bubble 
                for a minute or two.
            </li>
            <li>Add the cream to the pan, along with the salmon. 
                Let it cook for a few more minutes until the 
                sauce has thickened a bit and the fish has cooked 
                through.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
